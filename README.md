I am currently a sophomore enrolled at Saint Francis University. I am majoring in Cybersecurity and minoring in Computer Science and Philosophy. I come from the small town of Northern Cambria and am very interested in technology.

## Objective

Pursuing my degree in Cybersecurity, I plan to continue to build my skills in Digital Forensics and Pen Testing. I aim to apply what I have learned in Digital Forensics to contribute to real-world investigations and assessments. I am very curious and love learning about new things and tools that can better my understanding in the field.
